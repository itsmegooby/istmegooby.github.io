### Constants and Keywords
A constant is an element of a program whose value can not be changed at the time of execution and they are called literals. It may be an int, a float or char data type.
Using constants in a program
There are two ways of using constants in C++ program.

* Using const keyword.
* Using #define preprocessor.

#### using #define preprocessor.

 For example
 
**#define variable value**

```cpp
#define WIDTH 34;
```
#### Using const keyword
```cpp

You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type
const type variable =value;
Eg const int WIDTH =34;


A keyword is a word whose meaning is already defined by compiler. These keywords cannot be used as variable name.
Some keywords are given below
1 default
2 float
3 register 
4 struct
5 volatile
6 break

```
