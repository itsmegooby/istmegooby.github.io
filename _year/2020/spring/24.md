## Union in C++

```cpp
It is a user defined in which all members share the same memory location, the size of the union is determined by the largest member of the union. Unlike structures only one field is used at a given time. It doesnâ€™t allow multiple values simultaneously. It can only store one value at a time.
```

### Syntax

```
union union_name
{
//datatypes
}union_variable;
```

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
union student
{
	
   float mark;
	int age;
};
int main()

 { student  student1;//declaring variable for union
   student1.age=45;
   student1.mark=71.9;
	cout<<student1.age<<endl;
	cout<<student1.mark;
	
}
```

In the example above only student1.mark will display the correct value the other variable will be given a garbage value.
