## Inheritance in C++
```cpp
In simpler terms inheritance is a process of getting property of another class into another class. Or we can say getting a new class from an old class, were we can call the new class as child class and the old class as the parent class.
So when we say a class has inherited the property of a class meaning it can access all the data member and member function of that class except private element.
```

### How to inherit one class into another

```
child class: access specifier parent class
```

### for example


```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//parent class
class Multply
{
	public:
		float x,y,z;
		void mult()
		{
			x=89,y=67;
			z=x*y;
			cout<<z<<endl;
		}
};
//child class able to access public members of parent class
class Divide:public Multply
{
	public:
	void divid()
	{
		z=x/y;
		cout<<z;
	}
};
int main()
{
	Divide num;
	//calling the function using object of child class
	num.mult();
	num.divid();
	return 0;
}
```
