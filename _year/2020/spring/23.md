## Nested structures in C++

A nested structure is a structure in another structures. To nest a structure inside of another structure we have to declare the nested structure before the structure its being nested in .
### Syntax

```
struct nested_structure_name
{
//datatypes
};
struct           name_for_nesting_structure
{
//datatypes
struct  nested_structure_name   variable_name_for_nested_structure;

}structureâ€™s_variable;
```

### For example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
struct address
{
 string city="lusaka";
 string houseno= "124/96";	
};
struct student
{
	string name="DOREEN";
	int mark=60;
	struct address address1;
}student1;
int main ()
{
	cout<<student1.address1.city<<endl;
	cout<<student1.address1.houseno<<endl;
	cout<<student1.mark<<endl;
	cout<<student1.name;
	
return 0;

}
```
