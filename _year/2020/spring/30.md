## Data Encapsulation in C++

```cpp
In the world of programming combining data member and member function into a single entity like class is a process called data encapsulation.
This is an important feature in Object Oriented Programming, it is used to prevent direct accessibility of data member and member function and this is done by using access specifier public, private, protected.
```

### Example of encapsulation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//declaring a class
class Numbers
{
	private:
		
	int x,y;
	public:
	Numbers (int num1,int num2)
	{
		x=num1;
		y=num2;
	}
	int display_x()
	{
		return x;
	}
	int display_y()
	{
		return y;
	}

};
int main()
{
	Numbers number(10,34);
	cout<<number.display_x()<<endl;
	cout<<number.display_y();
	
return 0;
```
