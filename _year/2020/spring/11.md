## do while loop

```cpp
do while loop is a loop used to perform looping operation. When the condition will become false the execution of the loop will b stopped. In simpler terms it means do this while this condition is true.
```

**Note: looping is to run the body continuously until a required condition is fulfilled.**

```cpp
do
{
//what should be done, also called the body
}
while(//the condition is true);
```

### for example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
int i=0;
do
{
cout<<i<<”,”;
i++;
}
while(i<=5);
return 0;
}
```
