*Day 22 of \# 50daysofC++ code challenge*

## Structures
A structure is a collection of data of different type, It is user defined datatype. The data can be of any data type for example int, float.  We can access a member of a structure by making the variable of the structure. We use the struct key word to create a structure.
### Syntax

```

struct structure_name
{
data_type variable1;
data_type variable2;
};
```
The following are some examples of creating a structure and its variable.
### Example 1

```cpp
struct student
{
string name;
float marks;
};
```

Here the structures name is student.
Now lets create a variable for a structure using method 1

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
struct student
{
string name;
float marks;
};
int main ()
{
struct student student1;
return 0;
}
```
In the above code student1 is the variable of a structure.
Declaration of structure variable method 2

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
struct student
{
string name;
float marks;
}student1;
int main ()
{

return 0;

}
```

Accessing the data members of a structure
To access the data member of a structure we use this syntax, structure_variable.data_member.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
struct student
{
string name=”Doreen”;
float marks=50;
}student1;
int main ()
{
cout<<student1.name;
cout<<student1.marks;
return 0;

}
```
