## Classes and Objects.

```cpp
A class in C++ is a building block that leads to Object-Oriented-Programming.
Accessing data members.
Access modifiers are used to implement an important feature of object-oriented-programming known as data hiding. Let’s consider a real-life example:
The Zambian secret informatic system which has five senior members have some top secret regarding national security. So, lets think of the five people as class data members. People who are not part of this system or class cant access information direct without being permitted to, this is what data hiding is.
```

There are three types of access modifiers
*	public
*	private
*	protected

**public:** all class members declared under public will be available to anyone.

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//declaring a class
class Person
{
public:
string food=”nsima”;
int age=20;
void eating()
{
cout<<”I am “<<age <<”years”<<” I can eat”<<” “<<food;
}
};
int main()
{
Person person1;
person1.eating();
return 0;
}
```

**Private:** class members declared as private can only be accessed by the functions inside the class or friend functions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//declaring a class
class Person
{
private:
string food=”nsima”;
int age=20;
public:
void eating()
{
cout<<”I am “<<age <<”years”<<” I can eat”<<” “<<food;
}
};
int main()
{
Person person1;
person1.eating();
return 0;
}
```

**Protect:** is similar to private, the difference is that the class member declared as protected are inaccessible outside class but can be access by any sub class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//declaring a class
class Personparent
{
protected:
string food="nsima";
int age=20;
};
class Child : public Personparent
{
	public:
	
  void eating()
{
cout<<"I am "<<age <<"years"<<" I can eat"<<" "<<food;
}
};


int main()
{
Child  person1;
person1.eating();
return 0;
}
```

**Note:** if we don’t specify any access modifiers for members inside a class, the members will be private by default.
