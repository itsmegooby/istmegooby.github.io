## Data Abstraction
In simper terms this means data hiding, this a type of programming essential data is shown to the user or outside the class and unessential data is hidden.
When we define class members with public specifier those members are accesses thought the program, whilst when members are define with a private access specifier the members wont be accessible throughout the program.
### Example


```cpp
 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//creating a class
class Adding
{

    public:
	answer(int num , int num2)
	{
		
	      result=num+num2;
		cout<<"sum is"<<result;
		
	}
	private:
		int result;
	
};
int main()
{
	Adding a;
	a.answer(20,30);
	return  0;
}
```
