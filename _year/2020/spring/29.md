## Constructors in C++
```cpp
A constructor is a member function of a class which initializes objects of a class.in C++, a constructor is automatically called when object (instance of a class) has been created. It is known as a special member function of a class.
```

The difference between constructor and normal member functions:
*	Constructor has same name as the class itself.
*	Constructors donâ€™t have return type.
*	Constructor is automatically called when an object is created.


**Note:** if we do not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generates one for us, except it has no parameters and has an empty body.

There are two types of constructors
*	Default constructor.
*	Parameterized constructor

### Default constructor
Default constructor is a constructor which does take any arguments, it has no parameters.
#### For example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//declaring a class
class Numbers
{
	public:
	int num1,num2;
	Numbers ()
	{
		num1=10;
		num2=20;
	}

};
int main()
{
	Numbers number1;
	cout<<number1.num1<<endl;
	cout<<number1.num2;
	
return 0;
}
```

### Parameterized Constructors
These constructors have arguments passed which help initialize an object when it is called. To create parameterized constructor we basically just addd parameter to it
#### For example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//declaring a class
class Numbers
{
	private:
		
	int x,y;
	public:
	Numbers (int num1,int num2)
	{
		x=num1;
		y=num2;
	}
	int display_x()
	{
		return x;
	}
	int display_y()
	{
		return y;
	}

};
int main()
{
	Numbers number(10,34);
	cout<<number.display_x()<<endl;
	cout<<number.display_y();
	
return 0;
```
