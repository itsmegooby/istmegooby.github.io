## Classes in C++

```cpp
A class is a collection of data members and member functions, data members are variables inside class while member functions are functions inside a class. It is also called user defined data type. 
```

Points to consider when creating a class 
*	Declare variable with appropriate data type.
*	Declare function as of given task.
*	Create an instance (object) of the class to access data member and member function of a class, for example classname objectname.
*	use dot operator to access data members and member functions.

An object has state and behavior, where state means what it has and behavior what it does. For example a pen has , state: Ink, nib, behavior: writting
### Syntax of a class

```
class Classname
{
Access specifier(private, public, protected
Data member 1
Member function 1
};
```

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//declaring a class
class Person
{
public:
string food=”nsima”;
int age=20;
void eating()
{
cout<<”I am “<<age <<”years”<<” I can eat”<<” “<<food;
}
};
int main()
{
Person person1;
person1.eating();
return 0;
}
```

**Note: **start class name with capital letter
