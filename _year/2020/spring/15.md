## Pointers in C++

Did you know that when we declare a variable in C++ the compiler sets aside a memory location with a unique address to store the variable?
Coming back to pointers, a pointer is a variable that holds address of another variable. They have data types just like variables. They can only store address of same data type, meaning that an integer type pointer can hold the address of an integer variable. We use the ampersand (&) symbol to get the address of variable. We use the asterisk(*) to get the value at the address which hold by pointer.

### Syntax for creating pointer in C++
```cpp
int *pointer;
```

#### For example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int a=10;
int *p;
p=&a;
*p =13;
cout<<a<<endl;
cout<<p;
return 0;
}
```

The above program uses pointer to change the value of a.
