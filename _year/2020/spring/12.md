## Arrays in C++
```cpp
An array is a collection of data of same data type, it is used to store group of data simultaneously.
It can store data of same data type meaning that an integer array can only store integer value. To access data from an array we use index point. Index of an array always starts from 0. Index value is always an integer.  Array can b of any data type like int, float, char, etc.
```

## Syntax of array.

```cpp
int num[5];
initialization of an array
int num[5]={2,4,5,6,7};
```

## for example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
int num[6] ={4,5,67,8,9,3};
cout<<num[0];
return 0;
}
```
