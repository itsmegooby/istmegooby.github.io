# Operators in C++.

wondering what an operator is?
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. We have a lot of built-in operators in C++. The following are some types of operators in C++.
An operand is a data or variable on which the operation is to be performed on.

* Arithmetic operators.
* Relational operators.
* Logical operators
* Bitwise operators.
* Assignment operators.
* Special operators
* Conditional operators

## Arithmetic operators.

NUM1=6
NUM2=3

| Operator   |	Description	                                                           | Example         
| ---------  |--------------                                                           | -------         
|  `+`	     | This operator adds two numbers.                                         | NUM1 +Num2=9    
| `-`	     | This operator subtracts the second number or operand from the first.    | NUM1-NUM2=3     
| `*`	     | Multiplies both numbers or operands.                                    |	NUM1*NUM2=18   
| `/`	     | Divides numerator by de-numerator.	                                   | NUM1/NUM2=2     
| `%`	     | Modulus operator and returns the remainder of an after-integer division.|	NUM1%NUM2=0
| `++`	     | Increment operator increases integer value by one.	                   | NUM1++=7
|   `--`     |	Decrement operator decreases an integer by one.	                       | --NUM2=2

## Relational Operators

|Operator 	|Description 	        |Example
|==	|Means equal to 	            |2==3 returns 0(false)
|!=	|Means not equal to	            |2!=3 returns 1(true)
|>	|Means greater than	            |2>3 return 0(false)
|<	|Means less than	            |2<3 returns 1(true)
|>=	|Means greater than or equal to	|2>=3 returns 0(false)
|<=	|Means less than or equal to	|2<=3 return 1(true)

## Logical operators

|&&	 |It is called the logical AND operator.                    |NUM1&&NUM2 is false
|    |If both operands are true then the condition becomes true.|
|    |For example, my book is both red and big, this is true    |
|    |(because and meets both conditions                        |
|`||`|	It is called the logical OR operator. The condition is  |
|    |true if one among the two operands is true	            |(NUM1`||`NUM2)
|    |                                                          |Is true 
|    |                                                          |
|!	 |It is called the logical not operator.                    |
|    |If the condition is true the not operator makes false. 	|!(NUM1&&NUM2)is true.

## Bitwise operators

|Operator 	|Operation  	|Example
|&	        |Bitwise AND	|x&y
|`|`        |	Bitwise OR	|x`|`y
|<<         |	Shift left 	|x<<y
|>>	        |Shift right	|x>>y

## Assignment operators

|Operator	|Example   |Same as
|=	        |x=y	   |x=y
|+=         |	x+=y   |	x=x+y
|-=	        |x-=y	   |x=x-y
|*=         | x*=y     |x=x*y
|/=		    |    x/=y  |x=x/y
|%=		    |   x%=y   |x=x%y

## Special operators

|Operator	|Description | Example
|&	|used to find the address of a variable|	int a=1; cout<<&a
|*	|it is used to find the address of a variable	|Int *p
|sizeof()|	It returns the memory size of a variable	|int a=1; cout <<sizeof(a)

## Conditional operators

```cpp
1?2:3
```
`1 -is the condition`

`2-if the condition is true`

`3-if the condition is false`
