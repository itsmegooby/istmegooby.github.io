## For loop in c++
```cpp
for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration which allows code to be executed repeatedly. In a for loop there are three parts namely initialization, condition and increment or decrement.
The initialization part executes only once.
All the three part of for loop are optional.
```

### Syntax

```
or (//initialization;condition; decrement or increment;)
{
//Code block to be executed
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
for (int I=0; I<=10; i++)
{
cout<<i<<endl;
}
return 0;
}

```
