### Functions in C++

A function in c++ is a collection of statements that perform specific task.  Function are executed once called. So for example we have a large program which is divided into a number of small building blocks for simplicity and the building blocks are called function. we can call a function again and again. Functions allow us to reuse code.
We have two types of functions 
* User defined
* Predefined 
A predefined function is a function predefined in library.
A user defined function is a function made by the user.
### Syntax of a function

```
Return _type function_name (parameter_list)
{
Body
}
```

**Return_type :** a key word used to indicate which type of value is being returned by a function. If we donâ€™t want to return any value we use void keyword in place of Return_type.
Function_name: it is the actual name of the function. it is also used at the time of calling the function.
**Parameter_list:** a place were we can pass a number of parameters or variables.
These variables may be used in the program.
The value of parameter can be initialized or we can pass it from the calling of function. it is an optional part.
**Body:** it is were the actual code is written to perform the specific task.
