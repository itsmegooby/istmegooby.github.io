## If and else statement.

```cpp
if C++ syntax
if(//condition)
{ //contains what is to be executed when condition is true
}
```
```cpp
if statement in C++ is used to check the given condition, if the condition given is true what is in the curly brackets will be executed. For example if jane is 34 she must go to school.
```
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
 int janes_age;
if(janes_age==34)
{
cout<<”must go to school”;
}
return 0;
}
```
```cpp
if-else
if-else syntax in C++
if(//condition)
{ //contains what is to be executed when condition is true
}
else
{
//what is to be executed when condition is false
}
```
```cpp

if the condition is true, if part executes and if condition is false else part executes.
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int janes_age;
if(janes_age==34)
{
cout<<”must go to school”;
}
else
{
cout<<”cant go to school”;
}

return 0;
}
 ```
