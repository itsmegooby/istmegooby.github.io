### Math function in C++

It is used to perform the mathematical related operation.
We have many predefined functions in C library. all the math functions are predefined in math.h file.
For example, we use sqrt() function to find square root of a number.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
cout<<”square root of 25 is”<<sqrt(num);
return 0;
}
```
