*Day of  5 \# 50daysofC++ code challenge*

## Constants and Keywords
```cpp
A constant is an element of a program whose value can not be changed at the time of execution and they are called literals. It may be an int, a float or char data type.
Using constants in a program
There are two ways of using constants in C++ program.
1 Using const keyword.
2 Using  #define preprocessor.
```

For example, 
## using #define preprocessor.
```cpp
#define variable value

#define WIDTH 34
```
```cpp
Using const keyword
You can use const prefix to declare constants with a specific type
const type variable =value;
Eg const int WIDTH =34;
```

A keyword is a word whose meaning is already defined by compiler. These keywords cannot be used as variable name.
Some keywords are given below

1 `default`

2 `float`

3 `register `

4 `struct`

5 `volatile`

6 `break`
