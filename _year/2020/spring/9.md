*Day 9 of \#50daysofC++ code challenge*

## Switch statement.
```cpp
The switch statement in C++ allows us to execute one statement, and this statement is called case.
We have a lot of cases used inside the body of the switch. A parameter is passed and from which case this parameter is matched the code is executed.
```

### Syntax

```cpp
switch (//parameter)
{
case 1:
   statement 1; 
   break;
case 2:
   statement 2;
   break;
default: 
     default  statement;
}```
```cpp
In the above code , in the switch statement a value is passed in place of parameter and the case will execute which is equal to that value.
If no case is matched with parameter then the default case will be executed.
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{   int num=2;
    switch (num)
{
case 1:
    cout<<”it is number 1”;
    break;
case 2:
   cout<<”it is number 2”;
  break;
default:
    cout<<”no case matchd”;

}
return 0;
}
```


**Note**:

 ```cpp 
whenever a break statement is encountered in switch case block, the control comes out of the switch-case body.
```
